# ReactDIDemo

This repository contains the steps and code for using InversifyJS with a React application.  The back end API will be the template ASP.NET Core React/Redux template that comes with .NET Core 3.0.  The demo does not focus on the API and no code changes are necessary to the API so knowledgde of C# or .NET is not necessary.  All of the changes will be within the ClientApp folder of the project since that is where the React/Redux application is stored.  

In order to run the application you must have .NET Core 3.0+ installed on your computer and run the following command from the root of the project folder:

dotnet run
